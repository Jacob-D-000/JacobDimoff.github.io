	<h1>Learning Reflection</h1>
	<section>
		<article>
				<p>
					My entre has been dedicated to learning and growing my academic knowledge. Even as early as middle school I can remember trying to understand math way above my grade level and reading as many books as I could about space. Despite my goals coming  down to earth as an adult, my pursuit of knowledge as only grown. Before coming to COGS, I inital study chemistry as Acadia university. I was ecited to move out on my own, learn what I wanted to learn and be my own person.
				</p> 
				<p>
					In 2021, I went to my first class ready to go and enjoyied the experience. I studied calculus, phyisic and  chemistry as well as other electives. As the months moved on however, I came I discovred something about myself. The first major exam we had was in phyisic and I only managed to screape about a 60%. This defistated me and served as a was a real blow to my ego. I relased I needed to step up my game or else I would barely pass. Despite my best efforts, the work containued to pile up at a rate I wasn't prepared for. My breaking point was in a physics middeterm where I had a mental breakdown and wasn't able to finsh the exam. In the end, I left Acadia without finsihing my first term of class</p>
				<p>
					Despite leaving Acadia, learned alot about myself at the time. On the sruface, I realized that chemsityr, and by extesion university was not something that suited my style of lwarning. The fun times I found myself enjoying class came from hands on work in a lab environment, not the siting in a stuff classroom learn threoy. On a emtional level however, I realised I wasn't ready for an environment that intese. So I took some time off like I propbably should have. I took the time to learn about how to destress and manage how work. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that I'm back in post-secondary, I've decided not to choose a theroy based program. Instead, I choose a more hands on program in a field, that while I don't lmopw a lot about, has alwasy interested me and will most likely lead to a job I will enjoy on ce I've graduated. Stress about post secondary isn't gone, but I think I'll have better seucess now unlike previopusly.
