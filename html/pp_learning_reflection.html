					My entre has been dedicated to learning and growing my academic knowledge. Even as early as middle school I can remember trying to understand math way above my grade level and reading as many books as I could about space. Despite my goals coming down to earth as an adult, my pursuit of knowledge only grew. Before coming to COGS, I initial studied chemistry as Acadia university. I was excited to move out on my own, learn what I wanted to learn and be my own person.
				</p> 
				<p>
					In 2021, I went to my first class ready to go and enjoyed the experience. I studied calculus, physics and  chemistry as well as other electives. As the months moved on however, I came to discovered something about myself. The first major exam we had was in physics and I only managed to scrape about a 60%. This gave me realty check for what I needed to do in university and served as a was a real blow to my ego. I released I needed to step up my game or else I would barely pass. Despite my best efforts, the work continued to pile up at and at  a rate I wasn't prepared for. My breaking point was in a physics midterm where I had a mental breakdown and wasn't able to finish the exam. In the end, I left Acadia without finishing my first term of class</p>
				<p>
					Despite leaving Acadia early, I learned a lot about myself at the time. On the surface, I realized that chemistry, and by extension university was not something that suited my style of learning. The times I found myself enjoying classes that involved more hands on work like the chemistry lab, not the siting in a stuff classroom learning theory. On a emotional level however, I realized I wasn't ready for an environment that intense. So I took some time off like I probably should have before I went to post-secondary. I took the time to learn about how to destress and how to optimize my work flow. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that I'm back in post-secondary, I've decided not to choose a theory heavy program. Instead, I choose a more hands on program in a field, that while I don't know a lot about, I've always had an interest in and will most likely lead to a job I will enjoy once I've graduated. Stress about post-secondary isn't gone, but I think I'll have better success now unlike previously.
