			<h1>About me</h1>
			<article>
				<p>Hello my name is Jacob Dimoff. I'm currently studying IT Programming at NSCC. Despite my limited experience in the industry, I plan on becoming independet free lace programmer in 10 years time. In order to accomplish this, I have spent a lot studying and learning not only the technical rqwuired fpr the industry, but the soft skills as well. I will join a software development company to make connections in the industry, as well as to hone my skills. Even if I have to do grunt work as a programmer, I will be independet of that job when the time comes and be an freelace developer. I will even attempt to develop a video game in my spare time. Even if it never gets relased or published, I will make it. I will be indepeent developer.</p>
			<!-- has been dedicated to learning and growing my academic knowledge. Even as early as middle school I can remember trying to understand math way above my grade level and reading as many books as I could about space. Despite my goals coming  down to earth as an adult, my pursuit of knowledge as only grown. Before coming to COGS, I inital study chemistry as Acadia university byt lesst shortly after.</p> -->
